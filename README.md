# SharpCapSlewer
python script for SharpCap to auto-slew for capturing wide areas


- Configure the variables at the top of the script
- The script will save the images to your configured save folder with the file name RRR_DDD.png where R = frame number in R.A and D = frame number in Dec.
- The script adds a "Run Slew" button to the toolbar that you can use to start the slew program
- The script assumes you have already connected and configured the mount in another ASCOM app like Cartes du ciel/skychart/etc.
